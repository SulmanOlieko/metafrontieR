Description: An R package for implementing various metafrontier analyses for productivity/performance benchmarking, assessing efficiencies and technology gaps for firms operating under different technologies. It contains routines for implementing (i) the deterministic envelope proposed by \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s00181-007-0119-4}{O'Donnell et al. (2008)} via linear and quadratic programming, as well as (ii) the stochastic metafrontier proposed by \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s11123-014-0402-2}{Huang et al. (2014)}. The package also has functionalities for implementing latent class stochastic metafrontier analysis and sample selection correction stochastic metafrontier models. The package depends on \texttt{sfaR} by \href{https://github.com/hdakpo/sfaR}{Dakpo et al. (2023)}.
